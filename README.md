# Description
This site will keep a database of users, and check their alert status. if a user has an alert, the server will text/call the numbers in their profile, waiting 1 minute in between notifications. the alert status can be canceled by clicking the link in the text. 

This is also designed to work with a custom built fitbit clockface app. that clockface will monitor HR and immediately start the alert chain process upon loss of HR signal.
